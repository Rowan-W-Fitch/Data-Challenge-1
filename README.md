# Data-Challenge-1
test.py is by far the most accurate of the logistic regression models (~%80 accuracy)
in order to run test.py, you must install scikit-learn.

To install scikit-learn:
if you run windows, type into the cmd "pip install -U scikit-learn" (without quotes)
if you run mac, type into the terminal "pip install -U scikit-learn" (without quotes)
any issues with installation, refer to https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

the other python files are an attempt at building a logistic regression model from scratch, which was only able to achieve ~%50 accuracy due to inability to derive effective features for the data.
